# MontCo-ReImagining-Public-Safety


## Project Motivation
This Shiny app was built to display and track the progress of recommendations from the Reimagining Public Safety Committee in Montgomery County Maryland and to create an interactive platform that citizens and public officials can engage.

## Structure and Design 
We decided to use the R shiny framework to build this application. Individual(s) coordinating the RPS goals will be in charge of maintaining and updating the underlying data in a timely manner which would also update the visualizations in the tracker tab. The document used for this can be found in the data folder titled RPS Tracker Data.xlsx.

## Accessibility and Engagement 
We used the google translate API to insert a translation option for the dashboard as well as a google form to seek feedback from the community and individuals who visit the dashboard to seek feedback on the dashboard as well as the progress on RPS goals.

## Publishing 
The application is hosted using ShinyApps.io

## Credits
A considerable amount of the design ideas were borrowed from the city-of-baltimore/transition-agenda project
